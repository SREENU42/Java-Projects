# Library Management System (Java)

## Project Overview
The **Library Management System** is a Java console application that allows users to add books, search for books, borrow books, and return them.  
This project helped me apply **Object-Oriented Programming principles** such as Encapsulation, Classes & Objects, and Collections (`ArrayList`) to manage records efficiently.

## Features
- Add new books to the library
- Search books by title or author
- Borrow and return books
- Tracks availability status of each book

## Concepts Used
| Concept | Usage |
|---------|--------|
| Encapsulation | Book details are stored as private fields |
| Classes & Objects | `Book` and `Library` classes manage behavior |
| Methods | `borrowBook()`, `returnBook()`, `searchBook()` |
| ArrayList | Used to store multiple book records dynamically |
