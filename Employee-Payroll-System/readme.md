# Employee Payroll System (Java)

## Project Overview
The **Employee Payroll System** is a Java console-based application that calculates the monthly salary of employees based on basic pay, allowances, and deductions.  
This project demonstrates how to use **Classes, Objects, Encapsulation, and Methods** to simulate a real-world payroll process.

## Features
- Add employee details (ID, Name, Salary)
- Calculate final salary after deductions (PF/Tax/etc.)
- Display generated payslip
- Menu-driven interface for interaction

## Concepts Used
| Concept | Usage |
|---------|--------|
| Encapsulation | Employee salary and deduction values are private fields |
| Classes & Objects | `Employee` and `PayrollSystem` handle logic |
| Methods | Used for salary calculation and payslip generation |
| Arrays / Data Structure | Store multiple employee records |
