# Java Console-Based Project Collection (OOP + Fundamentals)

This repository contains multiple Java mini-projects built to practice and demonstrate Core Java concepts such as:
- **OOP Principles** (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction)
- **Control Statements** (loops, conditional statements)
- **Collections & Arrays**
- **Class, Objects, Constructors, Methods**
- **Problem-solving using Java**

Each project runs in the console and focuses on real-time use cases to simulate how Java is used in day-to-day applications.
