# ATM Simulator (Java)

##  Project Overview
The **ATM Simulator** is a console-based Java application that imitates basic ATM operations such as balance inquiry, cash withdrawal, deposit, and PIN verification.  
This project helped me apply Object-Oriented Programming concepts like **Classes, Objects, Encapsulation, and Methods** in a real-world scenario.

## Features
-  PIN Authentication  
-  Check Account Balance  
-  Deposit Money  
-  Withdraw Money (with balance validation)  
-  Clean menu-driven console UI  

## Concepts Used
| Concept | Where it is used |
|---------|------------------|
| Encapsulation | Private fields for account balance and PIN |
| Classes & Objects | `ATM`, `BankAccount`, `Main` classes |
| Methods | `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, `checkBalance()` |
| Control Statements | Handling user choices in menu |
