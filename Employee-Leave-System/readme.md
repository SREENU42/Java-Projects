# Employee Leave Management System (Java)

## Project Overview
The **Employee Leave Management System** is a console-based Java application that allows employees to apply for leaves and tracks their remaining leave balance.  
The project demonstrates real-world usage of **Object-Oriented Programming** concepts, especially Encapsulation and Inheritance, by managing different types of leaves.

## Features
- Employees can apply for leave
- Tracks remaining leave balance
- Supports different leave types (Sick, Casual, Paid)
- Validates leave availability before approval

## Concepts Used
| Concept | Usage |
|---------|--------|
| Encapsulation | Employee data and leave balance stored as private fields |
| Inheritance | `SickLeave`, `CasualLeave`, `PaidLeave` inherit from `Leave` base class |
| Polymorphism | Different leave behaviors handled through the parent class reference |
| Arrays | Stores employee objects inside an Employee array |
