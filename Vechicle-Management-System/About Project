# Vehicle Management System (Java)

## Project Overview
The **Vehicle Management System** is a Java console-based application that allows users to manage different types of vehicles using Object-Oriented Programming concepts.  
The project demonstrates **Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism** through vehicle categories like Cars, Bikes, and Trucks.

## Features
- Add and view vehicle details
- Categorize vehicles based on type
- Calculate service charges (method overriding for different vehicle types)
- Display formatted vehicle report

## Concepts Used
| Concept | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Classes & Objects | Vehicle objects represent real-world entities |
| Inheritance | Car, Bike, and Truck inherit from base `Vehicle` class |
| Polymorphism (Method Overriding) | Each vehicle type calculates service cost differently |
| Encapsulation | Private fields with getters/setters to protect data |
