# Student Grade Management System (Java)

## Project Overview
The **Student Grade Management System** is a Java console-based application that allows users to enter student details, calculate total marks, determine grade, and generate a results summary.  
This project helped me understand **Encapsulation, Classes, Objects, and Conditional Logic** in Java.

## Features
- Add student details (name, roll number, subject marks)
- Calculate total and average marks
- Assign grade based on performance
- Display formatted report

## Concepts Used
| Concept | Usage |
|---------|--------|
| Encapsulation | Student marks and details stored in private fields |
| Classes & Objects | `Student` class to store data, separate class for grade logic |
| Conditional Statements | Used for grading based on score range |
| Arrays / Loops | Store and process multiple student records |
