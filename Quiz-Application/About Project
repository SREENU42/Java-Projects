# Quiz Application (Java)

## Project Overview
The **Quiz Application** is a Java console-based program that displays multiple-choice questions, accepts user answers, and calculates the final score.  
This project helped me understand how to structure programs using **Classes, Encapsulation, and Polymorphism** (method overloading for scoring logic).

## Features
- Stores questions and correct answers
- Displays one question at a time
- Calculates total score based on correct answers
- Simple and interactive menu-driven flow

## Concepts Used
| Concept | Usage |
|---------|--------|
| Encapsulation | Question data stored in a class with private fields |
| Classes & Objects | `Question` and `Quiz` classes handle logic |
| Polymorphism (method overloading) | Scoring method can accept different inputs |
| Array / ArrayList | Used to hold the list of quiz questions |
