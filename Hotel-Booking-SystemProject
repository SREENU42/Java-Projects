# Hotel Room Booking System (Java)

## Project Overview
The **Hotel Room Booking System** is a Java console application that allows users to check room availability, book rooms, and calculate total charges based on the number of nights.  
The project demonstrates the usage of **Object-Oriented Programming concepts** like Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Method Overriding.

## Features
- View available rooms (Single / Double / Suite)
- Book a room by room number
- Calculates total bill based on stay duration
- Seasonal discount applied using inheritance and method overriding

## Concepts Used
| Concept | Usage |
|---------|--------|
| Encapsulation | Room details like type, price, and booking status are private fields |
| Inheritance | `SeasonalRoom` inherits from `Room` and applies discount pricing |
| Polymorphism / Method Overriding | `getPricePerNight()` overridden to apply discounts |
| ArrayList | Stores multiple room objects dynamically |
